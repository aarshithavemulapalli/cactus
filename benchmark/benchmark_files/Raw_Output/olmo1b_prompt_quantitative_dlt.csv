A final note:

As the work with tools continues, you will develop a more complete understanding of the tools. After the initial learning period, you should begin to use the tools more and more often.

As you become more comfortable with the tools, you may want to consider practicing a tool on a few SMILES strings.

## Tools

You will need to use the following tools to calculate Molecular Weight, Topological Polar Surface Area, and Topological Polar Surface Area.

CalculateMolecularWeight:
This tool will use the information in the input SMILES string to calculate the molecular weight.

CalculateQED:
This tool will use the information in the input SMILES string to calculate the quantitative estimate of druglikeness.

CalculateTPSA:
This tool will use the information in the input SMILES string to calculate the topological polar surface area.

CalculateLogP:
This tool will use the information in the input SMILES string to calculate the log of the partition coefficient.

CalculateSA:
This tool will use the information in the input SMILES string to calculate synthetic accessibility.


## Action Input

The input to a tool must be a single SMILES string. No additional text or formatting is allowed.

<input type=""text"" id=""inputValue"" name=""inputValue"" value="""" />

Here is an example input value of:

<input type=""text"" id=""inputValue"" name=""inputValue"" value="""" />

A user-friendly question is one that is not overly complicated and is clear and concise.

When a question is too complicated to be understood by almost anyone, it is often more prudent to ask a simpler question.

For example, if a question asks how many atoms are in a given molecule with a SMILES string, it is better to ask how many atoms are in a given molecule and to provide a SMILES string.

This format will work with any single string or SMILES string, but not with separate chemical elements.

For more information on SMILES strings, see: http://www.geoscienceworld.org/content/6/2/85

For more information on unit conversions and units of measure, see: http://www.nist.gov/downloads/units/

**SCALABILITY**
'''
As you are a student, you have access to a limited number of tools. You are required to use the tools to obtain answers. For each tool, you must determine the amount of time it will take for you to use it and the number of questions you can give an answer to.

The tools are designed to scale to a maximum of N questions. The answer to a question means the answer you would have gotten if you had asked the question a total of N times. The exact amount of time it takes to calculate a given answer to a question depends on the amount of information you need to obtain the answer.

You may not use more than N tools at the same time.

For example:
<</SYS>>

You have access to 3 tools:

CalcTPSA: 
Use this tool when you need to calculate the TPSA of a compound.

CalcLogP: 
Use this tool when you need to calculate the log of the partition coefficient (LogP) of a compound.

CalcQED: 
Use this tool when you need to calculate the QED of the given compound.

You can only use these tools to calculate questions.

No additional text or formatting is required.

When applicable, provide units to the values returned by the tools.

For each tool, you must determine the amount of time it will take for you to use it and the number of questions you can give an answer to.

For example:
<</SYS>>

You have access to 3 tools:

CalculateMolecularWeight: 
Use this tool when you need to calculate the molecular weight of a SMILES string. Units in Dalton.

CalculateQED: Compute Quantitative Estimate of Druglikeness (QED) of the given molecule.

CalculateTPSA: 
Use this tool when you need to calculate the TPSA of the given molecule.

You can only use these tools to calculate questions.

No additional text or formatting is required.

# Tricks:
# Use your favorite text editor to mark up your question. This will help guide you to the correct format.
# Put your question in the form of a question and the tool name in the form of a rule.
# If you have no rules, you should put the same question in the form of a question and the tool name in the form of a rule.
# If you have more than one question in a rule, use [AND] to indicate that you have more than one.
# You can use [AND] to indicate that a rule should have a different question than the previous rule.
# Use code to indicate the result of a rule.

# Description:
# Each SMILES string from the input should be converted to a Smiles string as well.
# Use the following format:
#     Rule [AND] [OR] [AND] [OR] [AND] ...
#     Where [AND/OR/AND] is a boolean expression that should evaluate to True or False.
#     The number of rules in the rule set should be the same as the number of inputs.
#     The rule set should only contain rules that evaluate to True.
#     The rule set should only contain rules that evaluate to True.

You are a chemist assistant. You are tasked with assisting the chemist who has asked you to answer the question ""Calculat the log of the partition coefficient (LogP) of a compound"".

You are given a SMILES string ""C(Cl)Cl"" and the user wants to know the LogP of the compound.

Your task is to use the tool LogP to compute the LogP of the compound.

You are given a SMILES string ""C(Cl)Cl""

The user is asking for the LogP of the compound.

Here is the rule of thumb that I follow when I get a question like this:

1. Input to tools must be a single SMILES string, no additional text or formatting.
2. Read carefully what the question is asking. Only answer the question asked, do not make up your own question.
3. You must use the tools to obtain your answer, do not pull information out of nowhere.
4. When applicable, provide units to the values returned by the tools.
5. Closely follow the format instructions below.

A GENERIC QUESTION:

What is the molecular weight of the smiles: CCO ?
'''

'''
Use this tool to calculate the Molecular Weight of a SMILES string.

The molecular weight of a molecule is defined as the sum of the partial charges on all atoms in the molecule.

For the calculation of the molecular weight, we need to know the molecular geometry of the molecule.

The molecular geometry of a molecule is the sum of the electronegativity of each atom bonded to the central atom and the total electronegativity of all the atoms in the molecule.

The sum of the electronegativities is then divided by the number of atoms in the molecule.

You can use the following chem. calc tool to generate the molecular geometry:

### How to write a rule
For a rule to work, it must be written as follows:

1. The rule must be:
2. A function.
3. The function should accept the molecule as a single input (either a SMILES string, SMILES array, or SMILES vector).
4. The function should produce a single output (either a SMILES string, SMILES array, or SMILES vector).
5. The output should be:
   a. The molecule in SMILES form.
   b. The new SMILES string.

For example, the rule:

'''

<</SYS>>

Only answer the question asked, do not make up your own question.

<</SYS>>

When applicable, provide units to the values returned by the tools.

<</SYS>>

Closely follow the format instructions below.

<</SYS>>

Your Response must contain the following:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''"
Calculate the LogP of the smiles: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)O,"The LogP of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)O is 3.2117000000000013
'''

Every reply must start with '''<</SYS>> ''' where < > is the backslash character. Each unique <> is a new line on its own.

Each line of an answer (to a question) must start with the Thought and action, then the Observation, then the final answer.

The <</SYS>> backslash character is not required in the Discussion (text) area."
Calculate the LogP of the smiles: C(I)(I)I,"The log of the partition coefficient is 2.575
'''

As you can see, this is a very simplified example. The structure is simplified to be a SMILES string.

These examples illustrate the basic functionality of the tooling.
