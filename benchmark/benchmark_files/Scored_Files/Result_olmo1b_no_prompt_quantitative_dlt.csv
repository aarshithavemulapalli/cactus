- GENE ECOLOGY

DNA was originally discovered in humans and bacteria. It is often referred to as the genetic material of life,
as a small piece of DNA can be used to make proteins to make other proteins, and produce enzymes. 
The DNA is made up of two strands of DNA, called a ""pair"", that are linked together by phosphate groups. 
The two strands are arranged in a double helix shape. The DNA molecule is composed of about 4,000 different types of bases 
(or bases), which are bonded to each other in a specific order. RNA can also be considered as a type of DNA.
- RNA can be converted into a protein, and a protein can be converted into a DNA sequence. 
- A DNA sequence can be used as a DNA molecule, in which case the DNA sequence is known as a ""deoxyribonucleotide"". 
- A DNA sequence can be used as a RNA sequence, in which case the RNA sequence is known as a ""deoxyriboNucleotide"" or ""RNA sequence"". 
- RNA is usually synthesized by RNA polymerases, which catalyze the formation of RNA. 
- A DNA sequence can be used as a DNA molecule, in which case the DNA sequence is known as a ""deoxyribonucleotide"" or ""DNA sequence"".
