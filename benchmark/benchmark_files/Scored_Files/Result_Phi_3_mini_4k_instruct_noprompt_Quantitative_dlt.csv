Golden Paper Award

Alexei Sharkovsky was awarded the “Golden Paper Award” for the best paper in the pharmaceutical field in 2016.

The QED is calculated using the following parameters:

logP: The logarithm of the partition coefficient between octanol and water.

MW: The molecular weight.

TPSA: The Topological Polar Surface Area.

Aromatic: The number of aromatic rings.

QED = 
1 / (1+e^(-0.3*logP+0.2*MW+0.01*TPSA+0.01*Aromatic))

The QED is a quantitative estimate of druglikeness. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a higher probability of the molecule being drug-like.

1. Introduction

The transition to renewable energy is crucial for achieving sustainable and environmentally friendly power systems. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, offer significant benefits in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. However, their integration into the power grid presents several challenges, including intermittency and grid infrastructure limitations. This technical report examines these challenges and provides recommendations for cost reduction and improved grid integration.

2. Renewable Energy Costs

Renewable energy sources have experienced significant cost reductions over the past decade. Solar and wind power costs have decreased by more than 90%, making them increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources. However, the initial capital investment for renewable energy projects remains a barrier to wide-scale adoption. This section examines the factors contributing to the declining costs of renewable energy and identifies strategies for further cost reduction.

New AI Tool Can Accurately Predict Barriers to Drug Synthesis

Source:

https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/new-ai-tool-can-accurately-predict-barriers-to-drug-synthesis/595384/

Summary:

* A new AI model can detect synthetic challenges in drug molecules and predict synthetic feasibility
* Model developed by IBM Research and 3D pharmaceuticals, with machine learning and structural data from the Medicinal Chemistry Platform
* Synthetic feasibility is a factor in developing safer, more effective drugs

The AI model developed by IBM Research and 3D pharmaceuticals, called Synthetic Feasibility Predictor, can accurately predict barriers to drug synthesis. The model was created using machine learning and structural data from the Medicinal Chemistry Platform, which is a public database of drug-like molecules. The dataset for the model comprised 2.5 million drug-like structures, including 80,000 unique molecules.

The model can predict synthetic feasibility scores for new drug molecules based on their molecular structures and functional groups. The scores range from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate greater synthetic feasibility. These scores can help researchers prioritize drug candidates and identify potential synthetic challenges.

The Synthetic Feasibility Predictor has been integrated with a drug discovery platform, allowing researchers to assess the synthetic feasibility of their drug candidates early in the drug discovery process. The model has been shown to perform well on both standard and novel molecules, including those with complex structures or novel functional groups.

This AI tool marks a significant step towards more efficient and effective drug discovery, as it allows researchers to prioritize drug candidates based on synthetic feasibility. By removing synthetic challenges early in the drug discovery process, researchers can focus their efforts on compounds that are more likely to succeed in clinical trials, potentially"

Understanding the balance of hydrophilic and lipophilic properties in drug molecules is crucial for their absorption and distribution within the body. One key parameter for assessing this balance is the partition coefficient, commonly referred to as LogP. The partition coefficient is a quantitative measure of a compound's solubility in a hydrophobic (lipophilic) and hydrophilic (aqueous) environment. A high LogP indicates that a compound is more lipophilic, while a low LogP signifies a higher degree of hydrophilicity.

The LogP value is calculated using various computational methods, which estimate how much a compound prefers to reside in a lipophilic (organic phase) versus an aqueous (water) phase. A commonly used computational method for estimating LogP is the ClogP method, which takes into account molecular structure and electronic properties.

A range of LogP values is desirable for orally administered drugs, generally between 1 and 5. Compounds with LogP values outside this range may have poor bioavailability or may be too hydrophilic (leading to poor membrane permeation) or too lipophilic (leading to nonspecific binding and toxicity).

LogP values are vital in the early stages of drug development, as they help in predicting the drug-likeness of a molecule. A balance between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity is important for optimal drug performance. For example, a compound with low LogP values may be highly soluble in water but poorly permeable through cell membranes. On the other hand, a highly lipophilic compound may be readily absorbed by cells but may also accumulate in fatty tissues, leading to toxicity issues.

An ideal drug molecule would have the right balance of hydrophilic and lipophilic properties to ensure sufficient absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) characteristics. This balance is often referred to as 'drugability' and is a key factor in the success of a drug"

Based on these calculated properties, how might this compound perform in terms of hydrophobicity, synthetic accessibility, druglikeness, and potential bioavailability? The compound's LogP value of 4.002 indicates it is moderately hydrophobic, suggesting it could have good membrane permeability, which is a positive attribute for oral bioavailability. A higher LogP often correlates with better absorption across lipid membranes.

The synthetic accessibility score (SA) is 4.167391302739001, which falls within the range of 4-5 on a scale where higher numbers indicate more complex molecules that are harder to synthesize. This might imply that the compound is more challenging to synthesize, potentially increasing the cost and time required to produce it.

The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Druglikeness) of 0.5692267993614908 is relatively low, indicating that the compound may not be highly drug-like. QED values closer to 1 suggest a molecule that fits well within the desirable properties of a drug, such as optimal molecular weight, lack of excessive hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and a proper balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. This lower QED score suggests that the compound may require further optimization to improve its drug-like properties.

Follow-up question 1: What if the LogP value is significantly higher, what could be an alternative reason other than the molecule's inherent hydrophobicity?

Elaborated textbook-level solution: A significantly higher LogP value could indicate that the molecule has a greater degree of hydrophobic character than what might be expected for its structure. However, this could also be due to the presence of substituents that are highly lipophilic, such as long alkyl chains or aromatic rings, which might not be initially visible in the SMILES string. Additionally, if the molecule has a conformation that exposes more hydrophobic surfaces to the solvent, this could also lead to a higher LogP. It is essential to consider the molecular structure and possible conformations to fully understand the implications of the LogP value in relation to the molecule's bioavailability.

Follow-up question 2: What if the LogP value is significantly lower than expected, what could be an alternative reason other than high polarity?

Elaborated textbook-level solution: A significantly lower LogP value than expected might suggest that the compound is more polar than anticipated, which could be due to the presence of polar functional groups or ionic moieties that are not explicitly represented in the SMILES string. Other factors that could contribute to a lower LogP include the molecule's three-dimensional conformation, which might facilitate hydrogen bonding or other polar interactions, or the presence of highly polar solvents in the environment from which the LogP was calculated, leading to solvent-solute interactions that reduce hydrophobic character.

Follow-up question 3: What if the LogP value does not correlate with other druglikeness measures, what could be an alternative reason?

Elaborated textbook-level solution: The lack of correlation between LogP and other druglikeness measures could indicate that the molecule has other properties that are more critical for its biological activity and pharmacokinetic profile"

Question: Calculate the molecular weight of the C17H21NO4S compound, which is found in the molecular structure: C17H21NO4S. In the structure, each atom is connected to another atom via a single, double, or triple bond. C17H21NO4S has 17 carbon atoms, 21 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, 4 oxygen atoms, and 1 sulfur atom. Additionally, calculate the TPSA, LogP, and QED of the molecule. For the calculations, use the following assumptions:

1. Use average bond energies for bond dissociation energies: C-C (348 kJ/mol), C-H (413 kJ/mol), C-N (305 kJ/mol), C-O (358 kJ/mol), C-S (264 kJ/mol), O-H (463 kJ/mol), O-O (297 kJ/mol), S-O (268 kJ/mol).
2. Assume the TPSA value is directly proportional to the number of polar surface atoms (O, N, and S) present.
3. Assume a hypothetical LogP value based on the presence of polar and nonpolar groups (O and S are polar, C and H are nonpolar). Use a scale where O and S contribute +1.0, and C and H contribute -1.0 to the LogP value.
4. Apply a QED calculation algorithm that assumes a linear correlation between the number of sulfur atoms and the QED value. Each sulfur atom contributes a +0.02 to the Q"
