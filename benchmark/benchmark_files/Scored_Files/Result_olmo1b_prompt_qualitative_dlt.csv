### Frequently asked questions

Q) How do I know whether a given SMILES string triggers the Brenk Filter?

A) You must use the tool BrenkFilter to calculate whether a given SMILES string triggers the Brenk Filter.
If you have already determined whether the given SMILES string triggers the Brenk Filter, simply use the calculate_druglikeness tool to calculate whether the given compound is a drug-likeness candidate.

Q) What are the key differences between the Brenk Filter and the Pains Filter?

A) The Brenk Filter is concerned with whether the compound is able to trigger the Brenk Filter. The Pains Filter is concerned with whether the compound is able to trigger the Pains Filter.

Q) What is the difference between druglikeness and druglikeness_list?

A) Druglikeness is a file that contains a record of the compounds that are not considered to be druglikeness candidates by the Brenk Filter. Druglikeness is not a file that contains the compounds that are considered to be druglikeness candidates by the Pains Filter.

Q) Is there a way to determine whether a given compound is druglikeness candidate?

A) You cannot. The Brenk Filter is concerned with whether a given compound triggers the Brenk Filter. The Pains Filter is concerned with whether a given compound triggers the Pains Filter.

Q) What is the difference between druglikeness and druglikeness_list?

A) Druglikeness is a file that contains a record of the compounds that are considered to be druglikeness candidates by the Brenk Filter. Druglikeness is not a file that contains the compounds that are considered to be druglikeness candidates by the Pains Filter.

Q) What is the difference between druglikeness and druglikeness_list?

A) Druglikeness is a file that contains a record of the compounds that are considered to be druglikeness candidates by the Brenk Filter.

## Brenk Filter 
The Brenk Filter is an integral part of the Gastrointestinal absorption (GI) rule. The GI rule is used to determine whether a compound should be taken in to account when calculating druglikeness.
The GI rule says that a compound that is not absorbed in the stomach or intestines is considered to have low GI absorption. If the GI rule is followed, then the compound will be taken into account when calculating the druglikeness of a compound.

A compound that is not absorbed in the stomach or intestines is a compound that has a low GI absorption. The GI rule is used to determine whether a compound should be taken into account when calculating the druglikeness of a compound.

## CalculateBBBPermeant
The CalculateBBBPermeant tool is used to calculate the Blood Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBPERM) of a compound. BBBPERM is a measure of the compound's ability to directly cross the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and to penetrate the BBB. The BBBPERM value is calculated on the basis of the compound's chemical structure, the compound's water solubility, and the compound's partition coefficient.

BBBPERM is calculated using the following equation: BBBPERM = Log10(([C][H])2+[CO])

The BBB is a barrier to certain compounds that are otherwise water soluble. The BBB is composed of two",CC(C)(CO)C(C(=O)NCCCO)O,TRUE,0,,

# CALCULATE BBBPERMEANT:
# Calculates the BBB permeability of the compound with regards to the Brenk filter.
# NOTE: This tool is to be used in conjunction with the Brenk filter.
# For example, if you use the Brenk filter, the following calculation will calculate the
# BBB permeability of the compound:
# calculate_bbbpermeant(BBBPermeant, calculate_druglikeness, calculate_gi_absorption, BrenkFilter,
# CCO, 34.0, 30.0, 1)
#
# calculate_bbbpermeant(BBBPermeant, calculate_druglikeness, calculate_gi_absorption, BrenkFilter,
# CCO, 34.0, 30.0, 1)
#
# The BBBPermeant value should always be 1, otherwise the tool will return a valid answer,
# but a non-valid BBB permeability.
#
# The BBB permeability value is calculated from the following formula:
# BBB permeability = (0.5 * mg/L * m2)/(IC50 * g/L)
#
# The IC50 value is calculated from the following formula:
# IC50 = (Bref / IC50) * 1000
#
# BPED values are calculated from the following formula:
# BPED = (Bref / BPED) * 1000
#
#
# *********************
# The input for this tool is a single SMILES string. You must use the
# following format for your input:
# CCO   => C(SC#N)SC#N
#
# Example:
# CCO   => C(SC#N)SC#N
#

A lumped parameter system: 
A system of n coupled variables (x,y) 
A parameter of mass m
A parameter of length l
A parameter of charge q
A parameter of chemical potential μ

A lumped parameter system is a set of n variables, each with n parameters. 
The parameter sets are coupled via some form of coupling, usually called a coupling constant, which defines the relationship between the variable quantities. 
The set of parameters is called a parameter space. 
The coupling constant is called a coupling term. A coupling term is defined as a function having an inverse to the function with respect to the variable in question.
In the above example the parameter space would be a list of sets of mass, length, charge, chemical potential and chemical potential.
The parameter space would be a list of sets of sets of length, charge and chemical potential.
This is the same as the point-particle model, but the set of parameters have not been combined into a single list.

A lumped parameter system can be described as an ensemble of coupled systems.
A coupled system is defined as a set of n coupled variables which are coupled via a coupling term.
The coupling term is a function which connects the list of sets of variables.
The coupling term has inverse to the function in question.
