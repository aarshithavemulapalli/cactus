### A brief introduction to the Pains filter.

The Pains filter is a filter that is used to evaluate the Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability. It is one of the most well-known filters and is used to test the effectiveness of certain drugs. If the blood-brain barrier permeability is low then the drug will cross the BBB barrier.

This filter is based on the idea that drugs that do not cross the BBB barriers, will have a low GI (gastrointestinal absorption) and will therefore be absorbed slowly and poorly.

The Pains filter is the most simple and famous filter for evaluating the intestinal absorption of drugs.

## Solution

I used a method called [Rough Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_set) to answer the questions. The rough set method uses a set of thresholds to determine the quality of a model. The method decides whether or not a molecule triggers the Brenk Filter, using the following thresholds:

* The BBP-score threshold: The BBP-score is the percentage of the molecules that trigger the Brenk Filter. This is the highest value that a molecule can have.
* The GI score threshold: The GI score is the percentage of molecules that trigger the Pains Filter. This is the highest value that a molecule can have.
* The GI-score threshold: The GI-score is the percentage of molecules that trigger the Pains Filter. This is the highest value that a molecule can have.

The method calculates the values of the above three thresholds using the following method:

```
(BBP-score >= 3.0) && (GI-score >= 3.0) && (GI-score >= 3.0)
```

The method calculates the values of the above three thresholds using the following method:

```
((BBP-score >= 3.0) && (GI-score >= 3.0) && (GI-score >= 3.0))
```

The method determines whether or not a molecule triggers the Brenk Filter using the following method:

```
(BBP-score >= 3.0) && (GI-score >= 3.0) && (GI-score >= 3.0)
```

The method determines whether or not a molecule triggers the Pains Filter using the following method:

```
((BBP-score >= 3.0) && (GI-score >= 3.0) && (GI-score >= 3.0))
```

## Result

The result of the solution is that the compounds trigger the Brenk Filter. 

## Conclusion

I was able to come up with a solution for the question, so I would say that I could apply what I learned in this class into real-life problem solving.",CCCCCOC(=O)C,TRUE,0,

You are a scientist, and you are analysing water to make a protein. You have found out that the protein is known to be an inflammatory protein, and that it is a possible target of the drug you are looking for.

You have only two tools: BrenkFilter and calculate_druglikeness.

BrenkFilter: You know that C1=CCC=O is not a valid Brenk Filter, so you use BrenkFilter to calculate the druglikeness of C1=CCC=O.

Calculate_Druglikeness: You now know that C1=CCC=O is not a valid Brenk Filter, so you use BrenkFilter to calculate the druglikeness of C1=CCC=O.
